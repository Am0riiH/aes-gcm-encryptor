# 🔐 AES-GCM Encryption Web App

A simple and educational web application that demonstrates **data encryption and decryption** using the **AES-GCM algorithm** directly in the browser.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt and decrypt any text using AES-GCM (256-bit)
- Clean and modern glassmorphism UI
- Works completely offline in any modern browser
- Copy-to-clipboard buttons for easy use
- Educational structure — perfect for learning client-side cryptography

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Type any text you want to encrypt.
2. Click **Encrypt** — the app generates a secure IV and encrypts the text.
3. Copy or save the generated Base64 ciphertext.
4. Paste the ciphertext and click **Decrypt** to restore the original text.
